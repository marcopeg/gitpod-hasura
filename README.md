üìù This projects builds on top of 2 custom Docker images:

- [GitPod Workspace Postgres](https://github.com/marcopeg/docker-images/tree/master/gitpod-workspace-postgres) provides with a data-persistent embed Postgres database that is executed inside your GitPod workspace
- [GitPod Workspace Hasura](https://github.com/marcopeg/docker-images/tree/master/gitpod-workspace-hasura) imports the Hasura Engine and provides the workspace with a CLI command `hasura_start`

You can check both _Dockerfiles'_ source code and adapt it to your custom needs.  
**I've personally learned a lot about GitPod and Docker by trying to put together this workspace.**
